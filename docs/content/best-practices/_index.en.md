When you deploy ShardingSphere Proxy on the virtual machine and want to use it in the production environment, we recommend that you use CloudFormat or Terraform for multi AZ deployment.

- [Terraform Deploys ShardingSphere Cluster in Multiple AZs](/en/operation-guide/using-terraform-to-deploy-multi-az/)
